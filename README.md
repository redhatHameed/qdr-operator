# QDR Operator

A Kubernetes operator for managing Layer 7 (e.g. Application Layer) addressing and routing within and across clusters. The operator manages *interior* and *edge* QDR deployments automating resource creation and administration.

## Introduction

This operator provides an `Interconnect` [Custom Resource Definition](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-kubernetes-api/extend-api-custom-resource-definitions/)
(CRD) that describes a deployment of [Apache Qpid Dispatch Router](https://qpid.apache.org/components/dispatch-router/index.html) allowing developers to expertly
deploy routers for their infrastructure and middle-ware oriented  messaging requirements. The number of messaging routers, the deployment topology, address
semantics and other desired options can be specified through the CRD.

## Usage

Deploy the QDR Operator into the Kubernetes cluster where it will manage requests for the `Interconnect` resource. The QDR Operator will watch for create, update and delete resource requests and perform the necessary steps to ensure the present cluster state matches the desired state.

### Deploy QDR Operator

The `deploy` directory contains the manifests needed to properly install the
Operator.

Create the service account for the operator.

```
$ kubectl create -f deploy/service_account.yaml
```

Create the RBAC role and role-binding that grants the permissions
necessary for the operator to function.

```
$ kubectl create -f deploy/role.yaml
$ kubectl create -f deploy/role_binding.yaml
```

Deploy the CRD to the cluster that defines the Interconnect resource.

```
$ kubectl create -f deploy/crds/interconnectedcloud_v1alpha1_interconnect_crd.yaml
```

Next, deploy the operator into the cluster.

```
$ kubectl create -f deploy/operator.yaml
```

This step will create a pod on the Kubernetes cluster for the QDR Operator.
Observe the `qdr-operator` pod and verify it is in the running state.

```
$ kubectl get pods -l name=qdr-operator
```

If for some reason, the pod does not get to the running state, look at the
pod details to review any event that prohibited the pod from starting.

```
$ kubectl describe pod -l name=qdr-operator
```

You will be able to confirm that the new CRD has been registered in the cluster and you can review its details.

```
$ kubectl get crd
$ kubectl describe crd interconnects.interconnectedcloud.github.io
```

To create a router deployment, you must create a `Interconnect` resource representing the desired specification of the deployment. For example, to create a 3-node router mesh deployment you may run:

```console
$ cat <<EOF | kubectl create -f -
apiVersion: interconnectedcloud.github.io/v1alpha1
kind: Interconnect
metadata:
  name: example-interconnect
spec:
  # Add fields here
  deploymentPlan:
    image: quay.io/interconnectedcloud/qdrouterd:1.9.0
    role: interior
    size: 3
    placement: Any
EOF
```

The operator will create a deployment of three router instances, all connected together with default address semantics. It will also create a service through which the *interior* router mesh can be accessed. It will configure a default set of *listeners* and *connectors* as described below. You will be able to confirm that the instance has been created in the cluster and you can review its details. To view the Interconnect instance, the deployment it manages and the associated pods that are deployed:

```
$ kubectl describe interconnect example-interconnect
$ kubectl describe deploy example-interconnect
$ kubectl describe svc example-interconnect
$ kubectl get pods -o yaml
```

### Deployment Plan

The CRD *Deployment Plan* defines the attributes for an Interconnect instance.

#### Role and Placement

The *Deployment Plan* **Role** defines the mode of operation for the routers in a topology.

  * **interior** - This role creates an interconnect of auto-meshed routers for concurrent connection capacity and resiliency.
    Connectivity between the routers will be defined by *InterRouterListeners* and *InterRouterConnectors*. Downlink
    connectivity with *edge* routers will be via *EdgeListeners*.

  * **edge** -  This role creates a set of stand-alone routers. The connectivity from the *edge* to *interior* routers
    will be via *EdgeConnectors*.

The *Deployment Plan* **Placement** defines the deployment resource and the associated scheduling of the pods in the cluster.

  * **Any** - There is no constraint on pod placement. The operator will manage a *Deployment* resource where the number of
    pods scheduled will be up to *Deployment Plan Size*.

  * **Every** - Router pods will be placed on each node in the cluster. The operator will manage a *DaemonSet* resource where the
    number of pods scheduled will correspond to the number of nodes in the cluster. Note the *Deployment Plan Size* is
    not used.

  * **Anti-Affinity** - This constrains scheduling and prevents multiple router pods from running on the same node in the
    cluster. The operator will manage a *Deployment* resource with number of pods up to *Deployment Plan Size*.
    Note if *Deployment Plan Size* is greater than the number of nodes in the cluster, the excess pods that cannot be
    scheduled will remain in the *pending* state.

### Connectivity

The connectivity between routers in a deployment is via the declared *listeners* and *connectors*. There are three types of *listeners* supported by the operator.

  * **Listeners** - A listener for accepting normal messaging client connections. The operator supports this listener for
    both *interior* and *edge* routers.

  * **InterRouterListeners** - A listener for accepting connections from peer *interior* routers. The operator
    support this listener for *interior* routers **only**.

  * **EdgeListeners** - A listener for accepting connections from downlink *edge* routers. The operator supports this
    listener for *interior* routers **only**.

There are three types of *connectors* supported by the operator.

  * **Connectors** - A connector for connecting to an external messaging intermediary. The operator supports this connector
    for both *interior* and *edge* routers.

  * **InterRouterConnectors** - A connector for establishing connectivity to peer *interior* routers. The operator
    supports this connector for *interior* routers **only**.

  * **EdgeConnector** - A connector for establishing up-link connectivity from *edge* to *interior* routers. The operator
    supports this connector for *edge* routers **only**.

## Development

This Operator is built using the [Operator SDK](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk). Follow the [Quick Start](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk) instructions to checkout and install the operator-sdk CLI.

Local development may be done with [minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube) or [minishift](https://www.okd.io/minishift/).
